        <b> Mahendra Singh Dhoni</b> is an Indian professional cricketer who plays as a right handed batter and a
        wicket-keeper. Widely regarded as one of the most prolific wicket-keeper-batsmen and captains, he represented
        the Indian cricket team and was the captain of the side in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in test
        cricket from 2008 to 2014. Dhoni has captained the most international matches and is the most successful Indian
        captain. He has led India to victory in the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2013 ICC
        Champions Trophy, the only captain to win three different limited overs tournaments. He also led the teams that
        won the Asia Cup in 2010, 2016 and was a member of the title winning squad in 2018.

        Born in Ranchi, Dhoni made his first class debut for Bihar in 1999. <mark>He made his debut for the Indian
            cricket team on 23 December 2004</mark> in an ODI against Bangladesh and played his first test a year later
        against Sri Lanka. In 2007, he became the captain of the ODI side before taking over in all formats by 2008.
        Dhoni retired from test cricket in 2014, but continued playing in limited overs cricket till 2019. He has scored
        17,266 runs in international cricket including 10,000 plus runs at an average of more than 50 in ODIs.

        occasions and winning it five times (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023). He has also led CSK to two Champions
        League T20 titles in 2010 and 2014. Dhoni is amongst the few batsmen to have scored more than five thousand runs
        in the IPL, as well as being the first wicket-keeper to do so.

        In 2008, Dhoni was awarded India's highest sport honor Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award by Government of
        India. He received the fourth highest civilian award Padma Shri in 2009 and third highest civilian award Padma

Though Dhoni scored 84 runs at an average of 48 including one half-century against South Africa and 272 runs with three consecutive 50-plus scores against New Zealand, India lost both the series.[46] Dhoni himself reached 8000 runs in ODI in the series against New Zealand.[83] Dhoni led India in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 where India finished as runners-up after losing to Sri Lanka in the final.[84] He was named as captain and wicket-keeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC.[85]

Following the third Test in Melbourne, Dhoni announced his retirement from the format.[87] In his last test, he effected nine dismissals (eight catches and a stumping), and in the process, went past Kumar Sangakkara's record for most stumpings in international cricket and also set a record for effecting the most dismissals in a match by an Indian wicketkeeper until it was broken by Wriddhiman Saha in 2018.[88][89] In the Carlton Mid triangular series in Australia, India failed to win a single match with Dhoni himself managing just 70 runs from three innings at an average of 23.34.[90]<br/>
